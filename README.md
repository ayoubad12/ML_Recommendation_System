# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative, content-based, and demographic filtering algorithms in Python. The system analyzes a dataset containing movie titles, vote counts, average votes, and scores to provide personalized movie recommendations to users. It includes a web interface built with Streamlit for users to interact with and explore movie recommendations.


To run the app execute the command:  

```
streamlit run app.py
```
