# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative, content-based, and demographic filtering algorithms in Python. The system analyzes a dataset containing movie titles, vote counts, average votes, and scores to provide personalized movie recommendations to users. It includes a web interface built with Streamlit for users to interact with and explore movie recommendations.

### Key Features:
***Demographic Filtering:*** Recommends popular movies based on general user demographics.  
***Collaborative Filtering:*** Recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.  
***Content-Based Filtering:*** Recommends movies based on the similarity of movie features.  

The projet is currently hosted in: https://ml-rsys.streamlit.app/
